"Create a detailed and robust constitution.md for a new mobile banking application. The goal is to establish the core principles that will guide the development of a scalable, secure, and modern system.																																								
																																								
The system will have a clear separation of concerns:																																								
																																								
Frontend: A mobile app built with React Native, using Expo for the development environment, and enforcing TypeScript for type safety and code quality.																																								
																																								
Backend: Serverless services deployed with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).																																								
																																								
The constitution should include non-negotiable principles for the following areas:																																								
																																								
Architecture:																																								
																																								
Backend: Principles for creating loosely coupled, single-purpose serverless functions.																																								
																																								
Frontend: Principles for a modular and component-based UI architecture.																																								
																																								
Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE):																																								
																																								
Guidelines for secure authentication and authorization between the mobile app and backend services.																																								
																																								
Principles for secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit).																																								
																																								
Requirements for input validation on all backend endpoints.																																								
																																								
Technology & Tooling:																																								
																																								
Specific rules for using React Native, Expo, and TypeScript to ensure consistency.																																								
																																								
Guidelines for using AWS SAM, including best practices for defining serverless resources and APIs.																																								
																																								
Quality & Maintenance:																																								
																																								
Principles for a test-driven development (TDD) approach, covering both unit and integration tests.																																								
																																								
Requirements for a consistent code style and automated linting.																																								
																																								
Principles for a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all changes are automatically tested and deployed.																																								
																																								
The output should be a single, well-structured constitution.md file ready to be used as a guiding document for all subsequent development phases (Plan, Tasks, and Implementation)."
