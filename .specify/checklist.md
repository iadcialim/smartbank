## MANDATORY - READ BEFORE ANY TASK EXECUTION

### New Chat Session Protocol
- [ ] Read current task status from `specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md`
- [ ] Identify next task to execute
- [ ] Reference Task Execution Protocol in constitution
- [ ] Ask user for explicit confirmation before ANY implementation
- [ ] Never assume previous session permissions carry over
- [ ] State "Per constitution requirement, I need your confirmation before proceeding"

### Before Implementing Any Task
- [ ] Have I read the Task Execution Protocol?
- [ ] Have I asked for user confirmation?
- [ ] Am I following the one-task-at-a-time rule?
- [ ] Will I provide testing instructions after completion?
- [ ] Am I referencing the constitution properly?
